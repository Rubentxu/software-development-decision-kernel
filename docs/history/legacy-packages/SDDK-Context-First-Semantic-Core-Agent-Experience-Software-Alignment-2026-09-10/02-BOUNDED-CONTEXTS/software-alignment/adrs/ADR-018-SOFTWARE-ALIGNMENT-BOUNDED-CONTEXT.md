# ADR-018 — Software Alignment as a bounded context

**Status:** Proposed  
**Evolution:** Software Alignment / Progressive Software Knowledge

## Context

The Semantic Core already defines canonical facts, objects, Decision Memory, SemanticGraph, Evidence, Authority, Packs and Agent Experience. The next evolution must reuse those authorities rather than create parallel stores.

## Decision

Create a peer bounded context dedicated to comparing observed software with intent, decisions and lenses. It produces advisory assessments and opportunities; it does not govern effects.

## Consequences

- implementation proceeds by strangler slices and UAT;
- new persistent state requires explicit state-class/authority/rebuild metadata;
- APIs may evolve internally as long as the semantic contract remains stable;
- assumptions discovered invalid during spikes require ADR amendment rather than additive workaround.
